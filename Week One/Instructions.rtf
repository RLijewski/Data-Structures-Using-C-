\f0\fs22 \cf0 Programming Exercise #4\
Example 1-12 defined a class personType to store the name of a person. The member functions that we included merely print the name and set the name of a person. Redefine the class personType so that, in addition to what the existing class does, you also can do the following: \
a. Set the first name only.\
 b. Set the last name only. \
c. Store and set the middle name. \
d. Check whether a given first name is the same as the first name of this person.\
 e. Check whether a given last name is the same as the last name of this person. \
Write the definitions of the member functions to implement the operations for this class. Also, write a program to test various operations on this class.\
