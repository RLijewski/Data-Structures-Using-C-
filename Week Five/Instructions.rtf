\f0\fs22 \cf0 Programming Exercise #2\
Extend the class linkedListType by adding the following operations: \
a. Find and delete the node with the smallest info in the list. (Delete only the first occurrence and traverse the list only once.) \
b. Find and delete all occurrences of a given info from the list. (Traverse the list only once.) Add these as abstract functions in the class linkedListType and provide the definitions of these functions in the class unorderedLinkedList. Also write a program to test these functions.\
